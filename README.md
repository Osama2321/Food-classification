🍽️ Food Classification App (Deep Learning + Gradio)
This project is a Deep Learning-based Food Classification App that identifies different food items from images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model has been trained on a labeled dataset of various food categories and deployed using Gradio to provide an intuitive web-based interface.

🔍 Features:
Upload or drag & drop food images to classify.

Real-time predictions with class labels and confidence scores.

Simple, user-friendly Gradio interface for interaction.

Supports multiple food categories (e.g., pizza, burger, sushi, salad, etc.).

🛠️ Tech Stack:
Deep Learning Framework: TensorFlow / PyTorch

UI: Gradio

Language: Python

Model: Custom CNN / Pretrained model (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet)

🚀 How it works:
Load the trained model.

Upload a food image via the Gradio interface.

The model processes the image and returns the predicted food category.
